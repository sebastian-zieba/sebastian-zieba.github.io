(last year) PhD student at the MPIA, Heidelberg, Germany and Leiden Observatory, The Netherlands

Later this year, I'll be joining the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the CfA as a [Sagan Fellow](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasa-awards-astrophysics-postdoctoral-fellowships-for-2024/) to characterize the surfaces and atmospheres of rocky exoplanets using JWST.

My research revolves around the characterization of exoplanets with space telescopes like Spitzer, Hubble, JWST, and the discovery of exocomets with TESS.  
My previous work includes:  
- non-detection of a thick CO2 atmosphere on **TRAPPIST-1 c**  
- **PACMAN**: a pipeline to reduce and analyze Hubble WCF3 data  
- Analysis of the **lava planet K2-141 b**  
- Detection of **exocomets** around beta Pictoris with TESS
