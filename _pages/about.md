Postdoctoral researcher at the Center for Astrophysics, Harvard & Smithsonian (Cambridge, USA)

In September 2024, I joined the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory at the CfA as a [Sagan Fellow](https://science.nasa.gov/missions/hubble/nasa-awards-astrophysics-postdoctoral-fellowships-for-2024/) to characterize the surfaces and atmospheres of rocky exoplanets using JWST.

My research revolves around the characterization of exoplanets with space telescopes like Spitzer, Hubble, JWST, and the discovery of exocomets with TESS.  
My previous work includes:  
- non-detection of a thick CO2 atmosphere on **TRAPPIST-1 c**  
- **PACMAN**: a pipeline to reduce and analyze Hubble WCF3 data  
- Analysis of the **lava planet K2-141 b**  
- Detection of **exocomets** around beta Pictoris with TESS

About me
--------

I grew up in Salzburg, Austria. After finishing high school, I moved to Innsbruck (Austria) to do my bachelor's and master's in Physics and Astrophysics, respectively. Between 2020 and 2024 I was living in Heidelberg being a PhD student at the MPIA (APEx department).
