(last year) PhD student at MPIA, Heidelberg, Germany

My research revolves around the characterization of exoplanets with space telescopes like Spitzer, Hubble, JWST, and the discovery of exocomets with TESS.  
My previous work includes:  
- non-detection of a thick CO2 atmosphere on TRAPPIST-1 c  
- PACMAN: a pipeline to reduce and analyze Hubble WCF3 data  
- Analysis of the lava planet K2-141 b  
- Detection of exocomets around beta Pictoris with TESS
